## Main Learnings:
1. Start using Jupyter Lab (version 1.0 released) (and Stop using Python 2 completely!)
2. Great conference for learning about tools and packages.
3. Don't expect to learn any machine learning/data science.
4. Good venue for recruiting (scientific software oriented developers/researchers)
5. Scipy-India: Probable conference for BTC
